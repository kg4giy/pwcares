Greetings,

Please find enclosed my Yaesu VX-6, Serial Number 8C420621. The symptom is that when I turn it on, the squelch opens up and stays open, even when there is no RF present. Screwing down the SQL only results in the radio going deaf (and it is pretty deaf otherwise). I have done the factory reset two step, and more than once. No joy. I suspect the issue is related to this: http://forums.radioreference.com/amateur-radio-general-discussion/222004-trouble-yaesu-vx-6-squelch.html - a failed component or filter. I did call and was instructed to send it on. 

Thanks,


DAVID
