## Rally Point [section-rally]

We will meet at the __McDonald's__ at __13500 Russell Rd A, Quantico, VA 22134__. This is the McDonald's located on base, at the __rear gate__ next to the Exchange. Please remember to bring appropriate identification to get on base (you driver's license is acceptable, other forms of government ID may also be).

We will meet at _0500_, we need to get the folks to the south end of the course by 0515, roads are scheduled to close around 0700. Race is scheduled to start at 0700. We will need to have those on the bike route help Brian set up NCS. 

## Mission [section-mission]

Our primary mission is eyes on the course to provide safety and back up the Marine Corps Marathon personnel. In the event of a downed cyclist or runner, contact _Net Control_ immediately. There will be an ambulance on site for the duration of the event under the command of _Top Doc_.

_Equipment_ 

This is a very large course. Mobile radios are prefered, but HTs will work. Be patient if you call Net Control. They could be talking with another station on Simplex that you cannot hear. 

Bring a chair and a book. There will likely be long periods without any excitement. 

At Start-Stop and the Water points you may want a headset - it can get very loud.

_Operational Parameters_

We will operate on simplex at __147.525__, the normal ARES operational frequency. If you use cross-band, please use input at __445.950__ __PL 100.0 Hz__ and output at __147.525__. These are channels __31__ and __36__ in the <a href="http://www.pwcares.org/doc/qrc.pdf">Quick Reference Guide</a>. There are a couple of crossband machines in use. Please remember to count to five after keying up to make sure the outbound side is open. And once someone drops their transmission, count to three before you key up. You may not be in a position to hear another station call net control. Remember, NCS has command of the frequency. If they ask a station to hold, please do so unless it is an _EMERGENCY_.

_Media Relations_

Any questions asked by the public or the media, are to be directed to the Race Officials. We will have our _PIO_, __Tom Fournier, W4PIO__ on site if anyone has questions about _Amateur Radio_ specifically. 

_Maps_
