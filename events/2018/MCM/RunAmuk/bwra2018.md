## Rally Point [section-rally]

We will meet at the [__McDonald's__](https://goo.gl/maps/CWYLQNpkfaK2) at __3500 Russell Rd A, Quantico, VA 22134__. This is the McDonald's located on base, at the __rear gate__ next to the Exchange. Please remember to bring appropriate identification to get on base (you driver's license is acceptable, other forms of government ID may also be). Talk-in on the Woodbridge 2m machine.

We will meet at _0530_.

## Mission [section-mission]

The _Belleau Wood 8K_ starts at __0645__ and there are about 800 participants already registered.  

The _Run Amuck_ starts in waves at __0715__ and there are about 1300 participants (sold out). 

Our primary mission is eyes on the course to provide safety and back up the Marine Corps Marathon personnel. In the event of a downed runner, contact Shadow immediately. There will be an ambulance on site for the duration of the event under the command of _Top Doc_. In the past, the Run Amuck has seen a number of injuries, generally ankle related. Because of the nature of the course, there will be a couple of gators running around to bring people from Aid 2 down to Top Doc at the main aid station. A transport decision will be made there. 

_Equipment_ 

An HT should be sufficient at most locations. We will have a high powered station at Water 1, hopefully with some sort of antenna mast. A head-set is almost a mandatory accessory, especially in the near-field area where they pump the music up to _11_[^fn-spinal_tap].

[^fn-spinal_tap]:It's a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088258/quotes">Spinal Tap (movie)</a> reference.  

_Operational Parameters_

We will be operating simplex at __147.525__, the normal ARES operational frequency. If you elect to use a cross-band to supplement your abilities, the input at __445.950__ __PL 100.0 Hz__ and output at __147.525__. These are channels __31__ and __36__ in the [Quick Reference Guide](http://www.pwcares.org/html/qrc.html).

_Media Relations_

Any questions asked by the public or the media, are to be directed to the Race Officials.
