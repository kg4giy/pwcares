## Mission [section-mission]

Our primary mission is eyes on the course to provide safety and back up the Marine Corps Marathon personnel. In the event of a downed runner, contact Start immediately. There will be an ambulance on site for the duration of the event under the command of _Top Doc_.

### Parking [section-parking]

We have permission to access the course. Everyone will need a parking pass (below and in email). Parking on the course is permitted. For those with locations on the blacktop, please stay on the blacktop or pull off on to a utility road. Those in the woods, the road should be wide enough for you to pull to the side. Please be aware of the vegetation.

Miles 3 through 7 may have better access from Joplin Road.

### Equipment [section-equipment]

This is a mobile event, and depending on your location, you will want all 50 watts. Depending on the needs at Start/Stop, an antenna/cross-band may be required (and can be loaned from stocks). 

A head-set is almost a mandatory accessory, especially where they pump the music up to _11_[^fn-spinal_tap]. Your vehicle may act as a good damper.

[^fn-spinal_tap]:It's a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088258/quotes">Spinal Tap (movie)</a> reference.  

### Operational Parameters [section-operation]

We will plan to operate on simplex at __147.525__, the normal ARES operational frequency. We will backstop this with the the K3FBI repeater at __147.345+__ __PL 167.9__. If things get really bad, we may switch to the Woodbridge machine at __147.240+__ __PL 107.2__. 

Brian WC4J will be testing an APRS tracker mounted to Tail-End Charlie, if we can get permission. Anyone else with APRS gear interfaced with radio should listen and contribute. Cellular access is poor within the forest.

Return to [Summary] [section-summary]

### Media Relations [section-media]

Any questions asked by the public or the media, are to be directed to the Race Officials. We will have our _PIO_, __Tom, W4PIO__, on site if anyone has questions about _Amateur Radio_ specifically.
