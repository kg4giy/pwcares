# Index

This is not meant to be a comprehensive index. Here are some of the files you will find.

* *.md* - These files are the source files for many of the new web pages. HTML is derived from these files using a number of tools.
* *.html* - These files are the actual web pages, and many of them may not associated markdown.
* *.css* - Cascading Style Sheets. The design elements of the web site.
* *.pdf* - PDF files, generally used by those that need a printed version of a particular work product, usually Quick Reference Guides. Depending on the age of the PDF, it may have originally been generated by *Microsoft Publisher*.

Most of the files are organized by year, a hold over of the old version control model used. As they are moved into Git, they will be more logically laid out.
