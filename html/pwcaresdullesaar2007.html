<h2><center>Dulles Drill 2007 After Action (PWCARES Comments Compiled)</center></h2>

<h3>1) Planning</h3>

<p><b>[General]</b> Communications between the parties could have been better.</p>

<h3>2) Execution</h3>

<p><b>[Bus]</b> Each bus should have 2 operators to work as a team to maintain situational awareness and back up the communication. Because the busses are mobile they will need to communicate on the (1) bus-net, (2) monitor the exercise net, (3) communicate on the hospital frequency they are assigned to,  (4) navigate to the hospital using a laptop based mapping program  while giving driving directions to the bus driver, (5) provide communications for the Red Cross coordinator on the bus, and (6) keep a count of the number of souls onboard the bus.</p>

<p><b>[Staffing]</b> We may want to talk about floater use use. One thing may be to assign them to a specific command center rather than just a generic location like the crash site.  I don't think anyone was aware they were available to be used. We did find ourselves reporting to the command  center on what number and level of "victims" were being sent to which hospital. That might be a specific task that needs to be looked at and if  needed forms developed.  it is good information to have available to pass on to hospitals. </p>

<p><b>[Staffing]</b> The biggest problem was that there were 4 of us who weren't given an assignment.  I felt underutilized and I wasn't experienced enough to know where it was  appropriate to get involved without being directed.</p>

<p><b>[Staffing]</b> Was there an IC shadow?</p>

<p><b>[Staffing]</b> Initially, people were really unsure what their jobs were when we showed up. That's fine, and quite real, but it didn't seem like there was much in place to figure out where to assign them and when.</p>

<p><b>[ICS]</b> Good practice using a staging area and being processed to specific assignments.</p>

<h3>3) Technical</h3>

<p><b>[APRS]</b> APRS worked well.  UI-View showed all the buses well on site and close to Prince William Hospital but not in between.</p>  

<p><b>[APRS]</b> APRS for tactical communications, despite the traffic also seemed to work well.  There was some discussion about ensuring there was an active terminal (a la UI-View) on each of the buses for that sort of comms, but that might prove impractical, especially with the digipeting issues that seem to have occurred.</p>

<p><b>[Bus]</b> Each bus needs to have a dual-band VHF/UHF antenna. Unable to access the bus-net UHF freq/repeater due to the bus antenna being VHF only. This forced the operators to monitor the bus-net UHF on HT's and relay messages to the command post on the exercise net. </p>

<p><b>[Dulles Ops Center]</b> Could Dulles consider a feedthru box at the Ops Center with four barrel fittings.  That would eliminate the need to have a secure door ajar with attendant outside noise, etc.  if not maybe next time we can jinn up an 84 - 90 inch batten to tape to the door to at least cut down on the noise and wind when we leave it ajar for cables.</p>  

<p><b>[Dulles Ops Center]</b> It looks like we need three more 25 ft coax runs to add on for that location.  It will enable us to get the antenna away from the building and I'm sure that will help with coverage.  We were very close to metal reflecting surfaces. (A total of 75-100 feet per antenna).</p>

<p><b>[Dulles Ops Center]</b> A better suggestion would be to permanently mount no less than three antennas on top of the MidField terminal with tri-band antennas on and run the connections into the operations office for APRS, packet, and at least two voice, or some other combination.</p>

<h3>4) Operational</h3>

<p><b>[Bus]</b> Prince William Hospital was manned and listening on 146.970 but the frequency was not on the published list of frequencies and the hospital was not manning the 446.000 approach frequency. [Author's note: the comment goes on to say that the PWC info was left out of the plan completely.  This is not the case.  Further, the complete list of frequencies was sent out several times to all participating members, including the hospital staff.  It could have been a lack of radios that caused the break down - needs investigation.]</p>

<p><b>[Bus/Hospital]</b> By the time the ambulance and souls on board was relayed to the bus / hospital net the patients where on scene. </p>

<p><b>[ICS]</b> I must admit I was lulled into complacency - next time you will get a full written 214 - needed or not.  It would have been handy to look back and see how long we went without an accurate patient count at PWHS.  regardless, it would have been good for the record and I should have paid attention. </p>

<p><b>[Net Ops]</b> Lack of order at net control.  Net should never say "I don't know please stand by" and when asked 2nd 3rd and 4th time give the same response! </p>

<p><b>[Ops]</b> Tactical calls used effectively but non iding per FCC regs would of resulted in no less then 7 Official Observer reports during the drill.  Remind operators that it is ok to start off with tactical but you need to ID on your last transmission or come up and say "Call clear" after traffic is down. </p>

<p><b>[Ops]</b> Unnecessary traffic on nets cluttering frequency.</p>

<p><b>[Ops]</b> "THIS IS A DRILL THIS IS A DRILL" (or similar) never used on net frequency.</p>

<p><b>[Ops]</b> Not everyone on the Crash Net could hear everyone else, which sometimes resulted in stepped on transmissions. </p>

<h3>5) Other</h3>

<p><b>[General Gear]</b> Go-kit will be expanded to always include a small toolkit and a mini-VOM.  A Bird wattmeter would also be beneficial. [Author's note: we had a bad piece of coax that was found using the old fashion swap method, which took a lot of time]</p>

<p><b>[Safety]</b> We should have taped something over the top of that Access Point battery to cover the terminals for safety.  We could have used any old piece of plastic bagging and some duct tape. (It had started to rain near the end of the exercise.)</p>

<p><b>[Safety]</b> Code word for real world emergency on patients (reaction to moulage) Drill  brief said it was "Real World Emergency" 2 patients having reactions used MTV as instructed by makeup took a while for doctors to make connection. </p>

<p><b>[Hospital Comms]</b> (this seems to be a reoccurring problem) General sense of confusion related to information that was suppose to be relayed to hospitals from Transport Section (?) and was not getting relayed. Unable to answer questions from top doc at PWHS about status.</p>

<p><b>[General Dulles]</b> I was impressed on the quick response to the early morning backup at the gate. </p>
