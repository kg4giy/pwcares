<p>All DECs filed their July monthly reports on time.  We have just a few jurisdictions that are still problematic.  I ask the RECs to talk with the DECs and bring these few jurisdictions into line so that none of our figures can ever be called into question.  The final report for the month went out to ARRL headquarters on time and was complete.  Be advised that the ASEC who compiles that report takes the comments of the DECs and places them in the final report verbatim.</p>

<p>We welcome <strong>Earle Moore, KR4MA</strong>, as our new <em>Assistant SEC for Winlink 2000</em>.  Earle has already made his presence felt in the Western part of the state with his help in the Radford Army Ammunition Plant exercise. Please also welcome our new ARES ECs--we wish them well in developing their units:
<ul>
    <li>Gary Grant Guthrie, Jr., KG4RGF, Franklin County</li>
    <li>Rick Armstrong, KS4XO, EC Montgomery County</li>
    <li>Charlie May, WD8LTP, EC Wythe County</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to all who reported in on working with "Determined Promise 04". The information you forwarded to the SEC made things go very smoothly.</p>

<p><strong>Joe Safranek, K4JJS</strong>, came up with a beautiful design for the ARES Veterans badge.  This is the badge we started talking about more than a month ago that beneath it will say, for example, "Pentagon", "Richlands Flood", "Hurricane Isabel"--real events that our ARES operators were directly involved in.  Shortly we will be pricing out this design to find out what it will cost per item.  that is, the badge plus the "bars" with the event-names above. Nice work Joe!</p>

<p>RECs, DECs and ECs, if you want your e-mail address linked on the website so people can contact you, contact me and I will assist you in getting it done.</p>

<p>The normal month for the ARRL simulated Emergency Test is October, however, ARES units and members have been through a series of simulated Emergency Tests with nuclear power plants, hospitals, arsenals, and DP'04.  Please ECs, DECs, and RECs, get your SET reports together on these events and U.S. Mail them to me. I will compile them and add them to the other SETs that take place in October and very possibly the Virginia Section could wind up as #1, 2, or 3 in total SET points.  Please cooperate with me to get this done at your earliest convenience.  I know some of you will be holding out for additional points for newspaper and media publication of your unit's involvement in these SETs.  Keep me advised if you have a SET report coming to me but will be delayed for this or other reasons.</p>

<p>Special thanks this month to <strong>Darrell Sutton</strong>, REC--East, who did an outstanding job of keeping the SEC and his Assistant aware of all developments happening as a result of Hurricane Charlie.  Also thanks to Keith Derringer for excellent liaison between the VA EOC and the Virginia Section of ARES.  The efforts of both of you are very much appreciated.</p>

<p>The SM, SEC, and I are extremely grateful for the outstanding turnout for Hurricane Charlie.  It appeared that everyone, everywhere, in every mode and frequency was ready to do business.  Even the Mutual Assistance teams were in the process of developing if they were needed.  I know we're all pleased and relieved that it turned out to be a "non-event", but it's still early in the hurricane season, so keep your Go kits packed and don't lose your edge.</p>

<p>There is a button on the ARES web site that says "About ARES".  This link will always take the viewer to a story about ARES, its members, its leadership, events it is involved in--almost anything you can imagine about ARES.  These stories are to be written by you--the leaders and members of the Virginia Section of ARES.  If you see, hear, or are involved in something pertaining to ARES that you believe would be of value for others to know about, write it up and send it to me.  I will share it with the SEC and hopefully it will wind up being published in the "About ARES" section.</p>

<p>The SEC asks me to remind all ARES leaders not to allow their ARRL memberships to lapse, because if it occurs their appointment is lost and they must reapply.  No one in this organization needs more work--please, don't let your membership lapse!</p>

<p>The Old Dominion Emergency Net (ODEN) of Monday, August 16, is an honest example of what ARES participation looks like lately.  Below is a list of Districts by number, followed by the number of people in that district who checked in.</p>

<p>Where we have the highest population of ARES members, we have the lowest participation.  Where we have the lowest number of ARES members, we have the highest participation.  RECs, DECs, ECs--this needs your attention!  Our HF capabilities in a large-scale regional disaster may well be necessary.  Let's get our people involved in this.</p>

<p>Interesting net developing on the 147.330 repeater (positive offset, no tone).  An ARES group in the Blue Ridge District, Rockbridge County, run this repeater KR4ZI, and it has a footprint that goes east to the Atlantic, West to Wythe County, and South to the Carolina border.  They are developing a regional net there, with the help of Blue Ridge DEC, <strong>Steve Presti, W4SVP</strong>, on Tuesday nights at 9 p.m.  You may want to check in.  Also on the same repeater on Monday night at 8:00 p.m. <strong>Dan Gilliam</strong>, EC Charlotte County, who is developing his ARES unit there, has a net for his unit, which is also taking on multi-jurisdictional characteristics.  You might want to drop in and say hello to Dan and his people.</p>

<p>Please notice on the first page of the ARES website that your EC and DEC reporting and member registration are now available there--just trying to make things as easy as possible for you.</p>

<p>Finally, thank you all for your good efforts.  ARES membership is growing at a rate consistently of 1% per month.  If this continues at 
this rate our growth this year will be substantial.  Keep up the good work!</p>
