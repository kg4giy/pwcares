<p>Democratic Committees of Manassas, Brentsville and Gainesville invite you to our second:</p>

<h2>Texas Hold 'Em Poker Fundraiser</h2>

<p>Come and help support the Democratic Party in Virginia with a night of fun and skill as you match wits with friends and colleagues in a Texas Hold 'Em Poker match.  No cash or prizes will be awarded (sorry 'bout that, it's those pesky Virginia laws) but winners will be awarded a certificate.*</p>

<p>For a small contribution of <b>$35</b>, you can find out how you stack up against local card sharks as well as learn more about the candidates in a friendly setting with $1000 in chips to prove you have the nuts.</p>

<p>Seating is limited.  RSVP to <a href="mailto:poker.committee@gmail.com">The MBG Poker Committee</a>, and send your check, payable to "Manassas City Democratic Committee (MCDC)" to:</p>

<p><b>Manassas City Democratic Committee<br/>
PO Box 4041<br/>
Manassas, Va. 20108</b></p>

<p>Remember cash in advance plays before cash at the door, so make sure we receive your check before Monday, October 15, 2007, to ensure sure you have a good seat at the game.</p>

<p>Non-playing guest are welcome for a small <b>($10)</b> contribution.</p>

<p>Play will be divided among the tables, which will be assigned according to skill, so here is your chance to try your hand!</p>

<p>Why are you still sitting there?  We are shuffling the cards!</p>

<p>Chips, appetizers, snacks, soft drinks will be served.</p>

<p>A contestant's lounge with Professional Texas Hold Em on TV will be set up for those eliminated early in competition.</p>

<p>We hope to see you in the Donkey Room, Saturday October 20, 2007!</p>


<p><i>*All proceeds and donations will be split evenly between the Manassas City, Manassas Park and participating Democratic committees in Prince William County. No cash or value prizes will be awarded to any participants. This is a fundraising event and does not constitute gambling as defined in the State of Virginia since no remuneration (cash prizes provided) and all players have an equal chance depending on the game they select.</i></p>
