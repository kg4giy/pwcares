<p>20. After discussion about the Amateur Radio Emergency Service, led by Mr. Walstrom, the Board was in recess for luncheon from 11:56 AM until 1:20 PM with current meeting participants present except Mr. Day. On motion of Mr. Walstrom, seconded by Mr. Goddard, the following resolution was unanimously ADOPTED:</p>

<p>WHEREAS, for security reasons and for purposes of establishing formal relationships with served agencies, ARES® groups within an ARRL section are increasingly in need of affirmative recognition; and</p>

<p>WHEREAS, ARES&reg; (Amateur Radio Emergency Service&reg;) is a program of, and both logos are registered trademarks of the American Radio Relay League, Incorporated;</p>

<p>NOW THEREFORE, it is ARRL policy that ARES&reg; groups, and any group using the ARES&reg; logo, shall acknowledge the nature of the ARES® program as an ARRL program, and abide by the guidelines of the program established by ARRL as amended from time to time, according to the following principles:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Each ARES&reg; group will, when using the term "ARES" or "Amateur Radio Emergency Service," utilize the &reg; symbol in any printed matter or in any electronic media, and will acknowledge that both logos are registered marks of the American Radio Relay League, Incorporated and are used by permission.</li>

	<li>In bylaws or other organizational documents, or by amendment of any existing bylaws or organizational documents, ARES&reg; groups will acknowledge that ARES&reg; is a program of the American Radio Relay League, and that entity will abide by the Rules and Regulations of the ARRL's Field Organization, as they may be amended from time to time, and by ARRL policies, rules, and guidelines contained in ARRL publications.</li>

	<li>All ARES&reg; records, membership rosters, and other data pertaining to the ARES&reg; program wherever located are the property of the American Radio Relay League, Incorporated.</li>
</ol>

<p>21. On motion of Mr. Walstrom, seconded by Mr. Butler, the following resolution was ADOPTED:</p>

<p>WHEREAS the ad-hoc committee, also known as ARESCOM, was created by direction from the ARRL Board of Directors to develop a comprehensive program to enhance the current ARES emergency communications capability to include rapid and accurate handling of long range (interstate, national, and international) emergency communications; and</p>

<p>WHEREAS this same ad-hoc committee has exceeded the Board's expectations by demonstrating a working network which implements the basic capabilities of the comprehensive program requested by the Board,</p>

<p>THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the ARRL Board commends the members of the ad-hoc committee for their efforts and expertise in inaugurating the current network; and</p>

<p>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the ARRL Board encourages further development and expansion of the inaugural network to broaden the coverage and continue its expansion; and</p>

<p>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the ad-hoc committee be requested to extend its charter until the January 2005 ARRL Annual Meeting of the Board of Directors for the purpose of completing a plan of implementation that insures the following:</p>

<ol>
	  <li>ARES&reg; is assured the prominent role in the management of this national network;</li>

      <li>The ARES&reg; officials at all levels and appropriate ARRL HQ staff will be given the opportunity to formally critique the operation of the network to assure that the requirements of ARES&reg; and its served agencies are being met by the operation of the network;</li>

      <li>The Winlink 2000 technical experts will positively address the results and findings of this critique;</li>

      <li>A plan be developed to assure timely upgrading of the network as new technologies emerge and future ARES&reg; requirements evolve; and</p>

      <li>Complete the negotiations and agreements necessary to assure ARRL access to the Winlink 2000 software.</li> 
</ol>

<p>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Board encourages the deployment of e-mail via Amateur Radio (as exemplified by Winlink 2000) as an additional emergency capability provided to agencies served by ARES&reg;.</p>
