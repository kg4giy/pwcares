<h2 id="section-rally">Rally Point</h2>

<p>We will meet at the <strong>McDonald&#8217;s</strong> at <strong>13500 Russell Rd A, Quantico, VA 22134</strong>. This is the McDonald&#8217;s located on base, at the <strong>rear gate</strong> next to the Exchange. Please remember to bring appropriate identification to get on base (you driver&#8217;s license is acceptable, other forms of government ID may also be).</p>

<p>We will meet at <em>0630</em>, roads are scheduled to close at 0700.</p>

<h2 id="section-mission">Mission</h2>

<p>The <em>One-Mile</em> race starts at <em>0830</em>. </p>

<p>The <em>10K Turkey Trot</em> race starts at <em>0850</em>.</p>

<p>Our primary mission is eyes on the course to provide safety and back up the Marine Corps Marathon personnel. In the event of a downed runner, contact Shadow immediately. There will be an ambulance on site for the duration of the event under the command of <em>Top Doc</em>.</p>

<p><em>Equipment</em> </p>

<p>Please note that the course has changed, and changed for the worse, at least for us. The good news is that a mobile will be able to hit the K3FBI repeater from most places on the course. An HT might be able to hit the repeater from some places on the course. Please plan to use a mobile or crossband for this event. <strong>Water1/Mile 3</strong> is in a hole, and I mean that in only the best of ways. There are hills on both sides of the location and they are easily 50 feet in elevation. There are also high tension wires running across the zone at 150 odd feet. Access to the site is by driving up the trail. It will pass a normal vehicle, but should have good off road ability</p>

<p>At Start-Stop, Shadow and the Water points you may want a headset - it can get very loud.</p>

<p><em>Operational Parameters</em></p>

<p>We will operate on the <strong>K3FBI</strong> machine on <strong>147.345+</strong> and it has a <strong>PL 167.9</strong>. Failing that we will operate on simplex at <strong>147.525</strong>, the normal ARES operational frequency. If you use cross-band, please use input at <strong>445.950</strong> <strong>PL 100.0 Hz</strong> and output at <strong>147.525</strong>. These are channels <strong>31</strong> and <strong>36</strong> in the <a href="http://www.pwcares.org/doc/qrc.pdf">Quick Reference Guide</a>.</p>

<p><em>Media Relations</em></p>

<p>Any questions asked by the public or the media, are to be directed to the Race Officials. We will have our <em>PIO</em>, <strong>Richard Spencer, KG4GFW</strong> on site if anyone has questions about <em>Amateur Radio</em> specifically. </p>
