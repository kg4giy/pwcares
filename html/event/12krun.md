## Rally Point [section-rally]

__DBIDS__: In accordance with Marine Corps Base Quantico (MCBQ) policy, all runners, volunteers, spectators, and sponsors requiring access to the base for the MCM Event Series must have an approved ID and be registered into the Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS) prior to being allowed on base. All individuals, age 18 and above, who do not possess a valid Department of Defense (DoD) issued ID card (CAC – Common Access Card & TESLIN – active, retiree, dependent, reserve, individual ready reserve) must register into the Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS) and stop by the Visitor Control Center (VCC) to obtain a visitor pass. Passes can be applied for up to 30 days in advance and obtained at the VCC, provided the application is submitted at least 14 days in advance of the event. Plan in advance to obtain the required access pass for any MCM Event Series date. Please visit the [MCM DBIDS site](https://www.marinemarathon.com/marine-corps-base-quantico-access-procedures/) for information. Passes can be picked up anytime before the event, but not on the day of the event. I will be sending contact information to participants as soon as I have it. 

We will meet at the __McDonald's__ at __13500 Russell Rd A, Quantico, VA 22134__. This is the McDonald's located on base, at the __rear gate__ next to the Exchange. 

We will meet at __0500__. The race starts at **0630**, but we need to get down the road before the traffic. Fortunately, there should not be a lot of traffic, but please arrive at the rally no later than __0515__.

## Mission [section-mission]

Our primary mission is eyes on the course to provide safety and back up the Marine Corps Marathon personnel. In the event of a downed runner, contact __OSV__ immediately. There will be appropriate medical support on site for the duration of the event under the command of _Top Doc_.

The _Quantico 12K_: The Quantico 12K hosts the 7.46-mile run through Marine Corps Base Quantico. Preparation begins here for Marines, as well as many runners training for the MCM.

Note: __Mile 7__ will be responsible for letting us know when the runners pass this location __OUTBOUND__ as well as when they pass inbound. Please pay attention to the calls from Mile 7 and ensure you understand which direction the runners are heading.

### Parking [section-parking]

We have permission to park at or near the critical points. Please ensure your vehicle is parked as far off the course as possible. Those supporting the Arch (Start/Finish) and the OSV will have parking provided in the staff parking area. For everyone else, park where it will give you the best view and is off the course. Course passes will be emailed individually.

### Equipment [section-equipment]

Based on our site survey, a mobile with an external antenna is preferred. Where possible, a headset is a valuable asset.

### Operational Parameters [section-operation]

We will operate on simplex at __147.525__, the normal ARES operational frequency. Relays may be needed. All support requests should be sent to __OSV__, where they will be managed in a similar manner to an EOC situation.

### Media Relations [section-media]
