<h2 id="section-rally">Rally Point</h2>

<p>We will meet at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/CWYLQNpkfaK2"><strong>McDonald&#8217;s</strong></a> at <strong>3500 Russell Rd A, Quantico, VA 22134</strong>. This is the McDonald&#8217;s located on base, at the <strong>rear gate</strong> next to the Exchange. Please remember to bring appropriate identification to get on base (you driver&#8217;s license is acceptable, other forms of government ID may also be). Talk-in on the Woodbridge 2m machine.</p>

<p>We will meet at <em>0530</em>.</p>

<h2 id="section-mission">Mission</h2>

<p>The <em>Belleau Wood 8K</em> starts at <strong>0645</strong> and there are about 800 participants already registered. </p>

<p>The <em>Run Amuck</em> starts in waves at <strong>0715</strong> and there are about 1300 participants (sold out). </p>

<p>Our primary mission is eyes on the course to provide safety and back up the Marine Corps Marathon personnel. In the event of a downed runner, contact Shadow immediately. There will be an ambulance on site for the duration of the event under the command of <em>Top Doc</em>. In the past, the Run Amuck has seen a number of injuries, generally ankle related. Because of the nature of the course, there will be a couple of gators running around to bring people from Aid 2 down to Top Doc at the main aid station. A transport decision will be made there. </p>

<p><em>Equipment</em> </p>

<p>An HT should be sufficient at most locations. We will have a high powered station at Water 1, hopefully with some sort of antenna mast. A head-set is almost a mandatory accessory, especially in the near-field area where they pump the music up to <em>11</em><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>.</p>

<p><em>Operational Parameters</em></p>

<p>We will be operating simplex at <strong>147.525</strong>, the normal ARES operational frequency. If you elect to use a cross-band to supplement your abilities, the input at <strong>445.950</strong> <strong>PL 100.0 Hz</strong> and output at <strong>147.525</strong>. These are channels <strong>31</strong> and <strong>36</strong> in the <a href="http://www.pwcares.org/html/qrc.html">Quick Reference Guide</a>.</p>

<p><em>Media Relations</em></p>

<p>Any questions asked by the public or the media, are to be directed to the Race Officials. </p>
