<h2 align="center">Civil War 150</h2>
<h3 align="center">The Sesquicentennial of the Battle of Manassas (Bull Run)<br/> July 21 - July 24, Manassas, Virginia</h3>

<p>From July 21 through July 24, 2011, the Sesquicentennial of the American Civil War and the Battle of First Manassas (Bull Run) in Old Town Manassas, Virginia. This 4 day event will feature living history demonstrations, speakers, art, music, and many other historical commemorations and activities for the family.</p>

<p>An estimated 10,000 - 40,000 people are expected to attend events in and around Old Town Manassas.  <a href="http://www.pwcares.org/">Prince William County ARES</a> has been asked to provide communications support by the City of Manassas and other participants coordinating the event.  Our mission is to support the life safety personnel on site at the living history camps and other locations as determined by the City.</p>

<p>As of Friday, July 8, 2011, PWCARES will need the following shifts covered in the following quantities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thursday, Friday and Saturday, we will staff 5 locations in the following shifts: 0700-1200, 1200-1600, 1600-2100.  On Sunday, we will have two shifts 0700-1300, 1300-1700.</p></li>

<li><p>The following locations will be staffed: Five (5) at Jennie Dean (lots of walking), two (2) at Manassas Museum (lots of walking), and two (2) each at Mayfield (some walking up and down hill), Liberia House and Cannon Branch.</p></li>

<li><p>For each shift, there will be an ECIC, located at the Incident Command post from 0700-1400 and 1400-2100, except Sunday, when there will only be one shift, from 0700-1700.</p></li>

<li><p>Saturday and Sunday, there will be two six hour shifts supporting the Prince William Hospital in Manassas and the Heathcote Medical facility.  The shifts will be from 0900 - 1500 and 1500 - 2100 each day.</p></li>

<li><p>We will need an additional three to five people for the opening ceremonies Thursday afternoon.  More details will be provided as they become available.</p></li>

<li><p>We will need an additional three people for the Parade on Friday from 0700-1200 estimated.</p></li>

<li><p>There is the potential that we might need more folks at the Pageland site, the location of the re-enactment.</p></li>
</ul>

It is to be considered the official list of who is where, but it is currently a document in progress and a number of changes, additions and modifications are expected between now and the event.  The spreadsheet and maps of the locations are below.

<h3>Briefing FAQ</h3>

<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: What do we need to bring?</em></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: You should wear clean, comfortable clothes, suitable for the weather over the course of your shift, including comfortable shoes and a hat (a call sign hat is appropriate).  An ARES vest is also required and will be issued if you do not have one of your own.  Bring any personal medicines, sunscreen, snacks and water.  Remember it is predicted to be hot and you will be outside for at least 5 hours.  You may bring a small cooler.  You may also want to bring a chair.</p>

<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: What radio equipment do we need to bring?</em></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Bring an HT, preferable a 2m/70cm capable radio, and a spare battery or quick charger.  If you would like to program frequencies in advance, we will be using 146.970- (PL 100Hz) for intersite communications and 147.525 simplex for intrasite communications.  Additionally, you might also want to include 445.975 with 100 Hz tone.  Additional frequencies are listed in the <a href="../doc/cw150-205.pdf">ICS 205 (pdf)</a> and the <a href="../doc/cw-150qrc.pdf">CW150 Quick Reference Card (PDF)</a>. </p>


<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: What will be provided?</em></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: PWCARES will provide a shelter at each location, adjacent to the cooling tent for the site radio, and a table to set the radio up on.  The site radio, antenna, stand, 50' of coax and an extension cord will also be provided.</p>

Further, PWCARES will provide, as possible, water and snacks for each site as well as food at the rest and refit for those between shifts [donations to PWCARES to offset the costs would be appriciated].</p>

<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: Will there be food at HQ?</em></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Yes.  Thursday there will be chilli with the fixings, cheese and crackers and other finger foods.  Friday will be fresh roast turkey (for sandwiches or just gnawing - you will have to arm wrestle Emma for a drum stick), and other finger foods.  Saturday will be pulled pork sandwiches and other finger foods. Sunday will be a smorgasbord of whatever is left over from the previous three days.  Water and sodas will be available each day as well.  I will not be serving <em>refreshing adult beverages</em> but you are welcome to bring your own for after your shift.</p>


<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: Where do we park?</em></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Because of the limited access to sites within the City of Manassas, all Amateurs will park near the PWCARES HQ at 9327 Camphor Court, Manassas, Virginia, 20110 and be shuttled into the sites from there.  This will also facilite the day-of briefing that will occur before every shift.</p>


<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: When do we report?</em></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Amateurs are expected to report no less than 60 mintues before their assigned shifts to receive the day-of briefing at PWCARES HQ.</p>


<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: What if I cannot make my shift?</em></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: If you have advance warning that you will not be able to make your shift, please notify David Lane, KG4GIY, as soon as possible!  We do not have a lot of flexibility in the coverage and having people not arrive in time or miss a shift entirely could jeapardize the entire operation.</p>


<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: Can I change my shift?</em></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Except for medical reason, there will be very limited changes to shifts after midnight Sunday, July 17, 2011.   It is possible that shift locations, within a shift time, may be shuffled right up to the day of the event for coverage reasons.</p>


<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: Will we be using HF?</em></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: No, there will be no HF for this operation.</p>


<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: Will we be using any digital modes?</em></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: We will be experimenting with FLDigi and flmsg as time permits but the primary mode will be voice.</p>


<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: Where are the sites?</em></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: With the exception of the Heathcote faclitiy, all of the sites are close to or in Old Town Manassas.  <a href="http://files.manassascivilwar.org/150_Map.pdf"> This is a complete map and schedule of events. (PDF)</a></p>

<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: What do I do if I am approched by the press?</em></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Direct them to the PIO for Historic Manassas [need to get the contact] or have them contact David Lane at <strong>(703) 361-3042</strong>.  If they just want to take your picture, that is up to each individual operator.  Please ensure if they do that you notify HQ so we can track it.</p>
