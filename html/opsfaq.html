<p><strong>Q.</strong> <em>From the 3 radio stations we have at the EOC, what exactly are they monitoring: Operations (Ops) Net, Logistics (Log) Net, Command and Control (CnC) Net, MedComm, NERA, VA Regional, MD Regional, etc?</em></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> It would depend on the operation...at a minimum, the Ops and Log Nets.  Beyond that it would be at ECIC direction - MedComm, other regional nets etc, although if we could have other liaison stations monitoring the other nets that would be best so that the EOC can focus on traffic to and from our Log and Ops nets.</li></p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> <em>An operator notifies the following that NOVA Regional Trauma Triage Plan (RTTP) activated: MedComm/Washington Metro VA Logistics/Washington Metro MD Logistics/VEN/A. Which operator from ARES would notify them: Operations NCS, Logistics NCS, CnC NCS or other NCS? Which operator from ARES would notify the EOC?</em></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong>This is complicated...One assumes that the NOVA RTTP activation notice comes from the Regional Hospital Coordination Center (RHCC - Fairfax) via liaison station to PWCARES so...  NCS notifies PWCARES EOC that he has traffic from the RHCC/MedComm liaison. Also the MedComm liaison could go direct to the EOC. </li></p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> <em>If there is an equipment failure of the Logistics/Operations/CnC repeater. Would the Operations NCS, Logistics NCS, CnC NCS or other NCS notify the EOC? Would they then notify everyone on that net about going to secondary/tertiary operating frequencies?</em></li></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> NCS would probably notify the EOC if the EOC didn't notice it first.  It would be up to the NCS to move the frequency but the ECIC could initiate the move via the NCS (the ECIC says move to frequency x and the NCS passes the traffic).</li></p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> <em>Equipment failure if a shelter radio fails who from ARES would request a replacement radio and dispatch a courier: Operations NCS, Logistics NCS, CnC NCS or other?</em></li></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> Operations would notify ECIC of the equipment failure.  ECIC would determine where the radio would come from (cache, logistics or "all call" for equipment).  ECIC would determine who would do the delivery based on available manpower and where the radio was coming from.</li></p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong><em> Who would track county/state resources being deployed within the county: ARES, County/State?</em></li></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong>From an ARES standpoint ECIC would track resources in the county and manage the deployment/requirements at the District level via the DEC.  Howard (DEC) would be responsible for State level management (that is his job after all!).  ECIC should know who is where and probably should know where they came from though.  One of the reasons ECIC needs an assistant to do the logging.</li></p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong><em> A distress call heard on 146.52 MHz under the wilderness protocol. Who from ARES would track/respond to this: Operations NCS, Logistics NCS, CnC NCS or other NCS?</em></li></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong>The first operator to hear the call would call it in to Operations.  Operations would ask ECIC how to proceed. Depending on the call, it might be handed off to an operator to deal with or integrated into the operation.  A secondary "net" might be required, especially if the call is outside the scope of the current emergegency.  All emergency calls get priortity clearly, but when we are already balancing a real event, calls from outside the emergency have to be balanced.</li></p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong><em> Who would track resource requests from County: Operations NCS, Logistics NCS, CnC NCS or other NCS?</em></li></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> The ECIC and the Operations NCS, since the requirements would come direct to the ECIC from the manager on duty or via WebEOC, through the EOC operator to the Ops Net.  Depending on the scope of the incident, the ECIC might delegate resource tracking to another individual.  For example, the EC might determine that an AEC should be ECIC while the EC deals with the resourcing requests.</li></p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong><em> Do we need to notify the newspapers to let them know that there is a drill taking place because I'm sure they will be listening and I don't want things to get out of hand with some of the messages, requests and events I have planned. If you think we do, do we need to have the county prepare a public announcement?</em></li></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> One of the reasons we prefece every message with <strong>This is a(n) [drill|exercise]</strong> is so that media outlets or others do not pick up our traffic and think there is a real issue currently underway.  So it is imperative that every piece of radio traffic have that header on it and at the end as well.  From a Public Relations perspective, it is up to the EC to determine whether or not to notify local media about an exercise ARES&reg; is participating in.</li></p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong><em> When an agency requests a resource, what is the path it takes from start to finish (requester to issuing agency to requester)?</em></li></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> In general, the requesting agency would put their request into WebEOC and route it to the apropriate resource. If the request is to go through us, either the EOC Liaision or the IC through the Logistics Branch would assign it to us to handle.  From there it would go out to the appropriate end point via the Ops Net.</li></p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong><em> When an operator arrives at their assigned location, whom do they notify? Operations, Logistics or both?</em></li></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong>Once the operator is dispatched, they shift to Operations, so they would notify Operations after they check in with the appropriate site personnel.</li></p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong><em>Once the operator notifies Ops Net, would Operations then notify the EOC of operator onsite?</em></li></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong>If EOC did not copy direct from the operator, OpsNet would notify the EOC and or make an entry into WebEOC.</li></p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong><em>When the EOC assigns something (site location/resource requests), it goes to Operations first for assignment. Does Operations than "assign" it to Logistics for personnel/resource coverage?</em></li></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> The deploy order goes ECIC to EOC operator to LogNet.  LogNet does the assignment since available operators are holding on LogNet for assignment (or, if we are staged, a staging officer has the list of availble staff).  Once the operator has the assignment, they clear LogNet for OpsNet and report in.  EOC may notify Ops for convenience, such as <em>Ops, EOC.  KI4FVV has been assinged to Battlefield Shelter</em>.</li></p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong><em>If an operator/resource is reassigned from site A to site B, should they notify Operations, Logistics or both of <strong>departing site A for site B</strong>?</em></li></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> Since the order to relocate came from OpsNet, the operator would only need to notify the OpsNet upon arrival a site <em>B</em>.  Only if the operator is released from duty at site A and are available for reassingment do they report to LogNet.</li></p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong><em> If a regional logistics net (Was/Metro VA/MD, NERA, etc) has a resource, do they notify local Logistics net or do they assign the resource "direct"?</em></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong>A lot would depend on the resouce and the business of the regional net.  The EOC could request direct from regional LogNet, but if regional has a resource they can notify local LogNet.</li></p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong><em>If an organization (Red Cross, Salvation Army, etc) orders "internal agency" resources, does that go through our Logistics/Operations nets? What happens when that resource arrives onsite?</li></em></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> For a non-Amateur resource, it would go across the OpsNet as it is traffic, like they were ordering butter.  For an amateur resource (out of the ARES&reg; pool), it would goes to the ECIC for dispensation based on who is availble and what other demands there are.</li></p>
  
<p><strong>Q.</strong><em> A General Aviation plane crashes into the power lines near substation on Sanders Lane/Lightridge Farm Road and Chatter Brook Drive (PW/Loudon border) and the power grid is unstable. Would we be providing Comms to NOVEC/Dominion Power?</em></li></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> If Dominion or NOVEC wants our help, and we have the manpower availble, yes.</li></p>
