<center><h2>Getting the Most from Your Hand-Held Transceiver</h2></center>
<center><h3>&copy;1998-2006 Virginia RACES, Inc.</h3></center>
<center><h3>by Ed Harris, KE4SKY</h3></center>
 
<p>A  portable transceiver with its original  flexible antenna should not be your primary rig for EmComm.  It’s true that many amateurs start with a "handy-talkie" or "HT" when they get their first amateur radio license.  Having learned from my experience in doing so more then ten years ago, today, I recommend that new operators buy 2-meter mobile transceivers as first rigs.  Mobiles cost little or no more than a good portable, but are much more useful.  For portable operation, you can easily carry a compact mobile transceiver in a briefcase with a 17ah-gel cell battery and telescoping 1/2-wave or 1/4-wave magnetic-mount mobile antenna.  Also include 25 feet or more of RG8-X (or better) coax to get the antenna up high, away from people.  This arrangement won’t work for everyone.  So, if all you have is an HT, the following will help you to “make the most of it!”</p>

<p>An "HT" does make perfectly good sense for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use on solo, foot assignments</li>
	<li>For anyone who doesn't drive</li>
	<li>Commuters who use public transportation</li>
	<li>Controlling a mobile radio as a cross-band repeater</li>
	<li>As a “spare,” backup or loaner</li>
</ul>


<p>The National Institute of Science and Technology tested Public Safety "high-band" VHF and amateur 2-meter antennas.  Flexible antennas commonly used on portable transceivers have -5db, “negative gain” compared to a quarter wave whip held at face level.  This means that a 5-watt portable VHF with flexible helical antenna has an effective radiated power of only 1-watt.  Carrying a  portable on your belt produces -20dB of attenuation, reducing EIRP to 50 milliwatts!  UHF results are similar.</p>

<p>Flexible "rubber ducky" antennas are rubber covered helical springs, intended to withstand rough handling, but they are not indestructible.  Flexible antennas used on  California fire lines for several weeks showed a 60% failure rate. Flexible antennas should be replaced as soon as they show ANY apparent kinks, cracks, abrasion or other wear to visual inspection.  For EmComm you should always carry a spare antenna of some type.</p>

<p>An expedient which improves the performance of a flexible antenna is a counterpoise wire (19." long for 2-meters, 11” for 222 MHz or 6.5" for 70 cm or 6” for GMRS) of stranded wire, crimped and soldered to a battery clip.  Attach the battery clip to the shield of a BNC connector, or use a ring terminal which will fit over an SMA connector, enabling you to thread the antenna over it.  Reinforce the soldered connection with heat shrink to resist flex.  A counterpoise prevents transmitted RF from coupling with your body. Your antenna now performs like a center-fed dipole, instead of an "end-fed dummy load!"  The main lobe of the radiation pattern can be "aimed" by, grasping and pointing the end in the direction where you need a stronger signal.</p>

<p>Some after-market and home-made antennas perform much better than the standard helical "rubber duck." A J-pole antenna constructed of 300-ohm twin-lead rolls up easily and fits into your pocket. When thrown up in a tree, it increases both height and gain.  Full-sized, flexible 1/4 wave and telescoping 5/8-wave antennas work very well. A quarter-wave provides unity gain when used with a counterpoise and held at face level.   This represents a 5 dB improvement over a short flexible antenna, because most of the effective signal is radiated. If operating from a vehicle, connect your portable rig to a magnetic mount mobile antenna to provide a clear RF path outside the vehicle.  This overcomes substantial attenuation, -10dB which results from operating a portable unit from inside a metal vehicle.  Always carry suitable adapters so that you can connect your portable transceiver to an outside base or mobile antenna, when one is readily available.  Pre-position antennas at shelter sites, etc. for this purpose.</p>

<p>In marginal operating locations a telescoping, half-wave performs  better, because it provides the same unity gain without a ground plane that a 1/4 wave antenna does when used with a ground plane.  A half-wave antenna can be pulled up into a tree, dangled out a window, attached to a window pane with suction cups, or be used bicycle or motorcycle mobile, or in city driving on a window clip mount.  A telescoping half-wave increases useable simplex range of a typical 5 watt, 2-meter portable in  average suburban ground clutter from about a mile with the stock flexible antenna to 3 miles or more, depending upon your height relative to the terrain.  Adding a counterpoise to a unity gain antenna enables a portable unit to keep in reliable contact within 5 miles of an EOC or base station equipped with a gain antenna on a tower.</p>

<p>Telescoping antennas are more fragile and work best when stationary or in the open.  Avoid side impacts, rough handling or prolonged mobile use of telescoping antennas on window clip mounts at highway speed, because excessive flexing loosens their internal electrical connections.  Never collapse a telescoping antenna by whacking it down with the palm of your hand. Gently pull it down with your fingers.  If you note any wobbling or looseness in the sections, replace the antenna. </p>

<p>Flexible antennas are safer when working in close quarters around people and are more durable when walking through dense vegetation for wildfire suppression, CERT or  search and rescue operations. They better for dual-band transceivers because telescoping antennas are usually mono-band.  Most dual-band flexible antennas approximate a 1/4 wave on 2 meters and a 5/8 wave on 70 cm, are optimized for one band and may resonate poorly on the other.  How efficient a particular antenna is can be determined only by testing.  A telescoping half-wave, or dual-band-mobile antenna with magnetic mount, which will work either with or without a ground plane, offers the best “bang for the buck.”</p>

<p>Any emergency antenna for your portable transceiver should be rated to handle up to 25 watts of RF output. This enables it to be used as an expedient antenna to use with a mobile radio in portable operation, or to permit use of an external "brick" amplifier with your portable radio.</p>

<p>A magnetic mount works best on a car, but an improvised ground plane can almost always be found around the home or office, such as a metal filing cabinet, metal trash can, cookie sheet, rain gutter, refrigerator, window air conditioning unit, balcony railing or any other large metal object.   On boats, motorcycles, fiberglass truck caps or wooden balcony railings use a half-wave antenna, which does not require a ground plane.  If you need to place an antenna on a bus or other vehicle where a mag mount won’t stay, use a suction cup mount shown <a href="http://www.w5fc.org/pse_docs/KNOWLEDGE/qst_p56.pdf"> here</a></p>

<h3>BATTERY POWER BASICS</h3>

<p>A common error of new operators is failure to carry enough battery power to last through a full 12-hour operational period.  As a minimum always carry at least one spare charged NiCd pack and a AA battery case, which enables you to keep operating when the power goes off, if you can't recharge your NiCd pack.</p>

<p>Cycle and recharge dry NiCd or NiMh packs monthly. Write the recharge date on a strip of tape on each pack.  In cold weather keep NiCd packs warm by keeping them in an inside coat pocket and not exposed on your belt. Do not store NiMh packs in your vehicle above 120 degs. F. if you expect them to hold charge more than a few hours.</p>

<p>An adapter cord to power your transceiver from an auto cigarette lighter plug or a gel cell battery is needed for extended operation.  Cigarette lighter cords are often unreliable because auto sockets aren't the best conductors, due to contamination and size variations, which cause the plug to vibrate loose.  As an alternate power source, you should still have one, because they are ubiquitous and in a pitch, much better than nothing!</p>

<p>Portable power packs such as Quantum are excellent, but expensive.  Encourage operators to make their own using 12-volt gel cell batteries obtained from local hospitals.  Sealed lead-acid (SLA) batteries power emergency lighting, alarm systems, medical instruments and computer backup power supplies.  They are replaced on a fixed schedule, commonly every four years, before the batteries are likely to fail from age. SLA batteries require disposal as hazardous waste unless recycled or reused.  A donation to your EmComm unit for reuse simply delays disposal.  It reduces their disposal cost and battery retailers or your municipal recycling program can often assist you on proper recycling or disposal once the batteries reach the  end of their useful life.  Contact your  hospital environmental officer to develop a battery reuse program to support auxiliary EmComm in your community.</p>

<p>Donated SLA batteries must be inspected, recharged and load-tested. A 12V battery with open circuit voltage (Voc ) of 12.8V or more can be tested immediately and distributed for reissue, if OK.  Batteries with Voc &lt;12.8V are connected in parallel across a regulated 13.8V power supply.   Those which do not accept charge after 4 hours are discarded.  Total charge time and current should not exceed 140% of battery capacity.</p>

<p>Recharging voltage for 12V  gel cells should never  exceed 14V due to gassing.  Reject batteries if their internal resistance exceeds an ohm.  This is determined by voltage drop divided by the current load in amps.  “Good” batteries suitable for re-issue should not drop below 11.5V under a test load approximating “C,” their amp-hour capacity, for 30 secs. or “C/5” for one minute.</p>

<p>A simple test load for small gel cells up to 20ah is a 50w, 12V-marine/RV bulb or automotive droplight. This equals about 3.8A, approximating a mobile radio on low power 5w transmit or a portable 2-meter hand held, plus laptop PC and packet TNC.  Use two 12V marine bulbs in a Y adapter to simulate a mobile or brick amp at 25w RF output.  This is a good test load for batteries up to a Group U1 (30 ah).  In a “good” battery voltage drop stabilizes quickly, does not fall below 11.5V under load and recovers quickly when the test load is removed. </p>

<p>MOLEX 1545 Series POWER CORD CONNECTORS - Are OK for low current loads like HTs.</p>

<p>Auxiliary power cords for low current devices up to 8A should use twin lead, red-black AWG14 or AWG16 “Zipline” with Molex Series 1545, 2-pin polarized connectors and .093 pins.  Female pins are assembled into the male plug, (attached to the power source) and the male pins into the female receptacle, (connects to the rig).</p> 

<p>The plug, receptacle and pin set is rated for 8A continuous duty and costs $0.99 from Radio Shack, Part No. 274-222.  Wiring is simple.  The end of the two-conductor Molex plug in cross section resembles a 2-story house with peaked roof.   Remember proper polarity by the word associations “red roof” and “black basement,” or “pointy positive” and “flat black.” Crimp wires before soldering to ensure a strong connection.  After inserting the pins into the plug and receptacle, check fit of the assembled fitting. Reinforce the wires behind the plug and receptacle with heat shrink or tape.  On the battery leads attach crimp female tab terminals to fit the male tabs on the battery.   Solder tabs to battery terminals and tape over them to prevent accidental shorting in handling. </p>

<p>If all you have is a portable transceiver, the above information will help to ensure that you can provide an adequate signal for reliable emergency communications. </p> 

<p>Doing so is vitally necessary to  enable your volunteer disaster unit to complete its mission efficiently and safely.  More information on emergency communications is available on the <a href="http://www.varaces.org/techrefs.htm">Virginia RACES, Inc.</a> web site.</p>
