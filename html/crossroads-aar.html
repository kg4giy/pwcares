<h2 id="section-success">Success</h2>

<p>PWCARES was able to deliver on its primary mission: providing eyes on course. Lead and tail were called in at each mile marker, demonstrating readiness by voice communications. No additional coordination was required of the cadre.</p>

<p>Net Control: Provided by Tom W4PIO. A VHF repeater was stood up next to the church. While not every operator was in direct range, relay was provided ad-hoc to carry informal tracking messages.</p>

<p>Liaison to MCM Command: Provided by Derek KV4SH. Informal tracking messages passed to XO Schmidt. Particularly, tail end position reports came from Amateur reports slightly ahead of commercial radios.</p>

<h2 id="section-fail">Improvements</h2>

<p>Planned site for temporary repeater was insufficient. The location where Brian WC4J was assigned had no siding, preventing antenna deployment. The location assigned for Tom W4PIO&#8217;s repeater was expedient, but could likely be improved.</p>

<p>Alternate sites include Turkey Run, which is usually fully populated by campers. For the Start/Stop location, being able to return the antenna to a site away from the powerlines would be prefered. </p>

<p>APRS Tracking: Tracker was emplaced on tail-end vehicle. Beacons were tracked well within a mile of WC4J&#8211;14, who provided a relay hop to the most common igate, W4KEL&#8211;12. A few data points were collected directly at the southern- and western-most points of the course by W4KEL&#8211;12. Other paths were found to use W4IY and N3HF, both of which were igated by W4VA. APRS information was not used to improve the tactical awareness of the event.</p>

<h2 id="section-goodideafairy">Suggestions</h2>

<p>Repeater emplacement: It may be useful to request early (prior day?) access to the course to set up the temporary repeater during daylight and identify site issues while able to move around the course. Of course, this must be weighed against willingness to leave equipment overnight. Rooftop access would be amazing.</p>

<p>APRS Tracking: The data tracks suggest that any packet able to reach a mobile station was able to reach the igates. The stretch between miles 5 and 7 was least well covered, and barren of reports.</p>
