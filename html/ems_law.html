<p>Virginia law requires that the driver of every vehicle shall immediately
drive to the nearest edge of the roadway, clear of any intersection, and
stop whenever an emergency vehicle with warning lights and siren
operating is approaching.  The driver shall remain stopped until the
emergency vehicle has passed and no other emergency equipment is in
sight.
<p>Frequently, drivers do not check rear view mirrors often enough, and it
is difficult to hear an approaching siren with windows up and a radio or
stereo on.  Its important to check your side and rear view mirrors every
ten seconds and always be alert to the possible presence of emergency
vehicles around you.
<p>Remember, if you were in need of emergency help you wouldnt want
thoughtless drivers delaying those en route to help you!
<p>46.2-829. Approach of law-enforcement or fire-fighting vehicles, rescue
vehicles, or ambulances; violation as failure to yield right-of-way. 
Upon the approach of any emergency vehicle as defined in  46.2-920
giving audible signal by siren, exhaust whistle, or air horn designed to
give automatically intermittent signals, and displaying a flashing,
blinking, or alternating emergency light or lights as provided in
46.2-1022 through 46.2-1024, the driver of every other vehicle shall, as
quickly as traffic and other highway conditions permit, drive to the
nearest edge of the roadway, clear of any intersection of highways, and
stop and remain there, unless otherwise directed by a law-enforcement
officer, until the emergency vehicle has passed. This provision shall
not relieve the driver of any such vehicle to which the right-of-way is
to be yielded of the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all
persons using the highway, nor shall it protect the driver of any such
vehicle from the consequences of an arbitrary exercise of such
right-of-way.
<p>Violation of this section shall constitute failure to yield the
right-of-way; however, any violation of this section that involves
overtaking or passing a moving emergency vehicle giving an audible
signal and displaying activated warning lights as provided for in this
section shall constitute reckless driving, punishable as provided in
46.2-868.
