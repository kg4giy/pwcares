<h1>Dale City Parade After Action Report</h1>

<p><strong>Submitted by</strong> : David A. Lane, KG4GIY</p>

<h2>What went right</h2>

<ul>
<li>Briefing: All useful information and details included.</li>
<li>Repeater Annex: Good coverage, even in the normally bad spots.</li>
</ul>

<h3>For the race</h3>

<ul>
<li>Having the list by name as well as number was useful, as was the break out of where people were supposed to be.</li>
<li>Good pre-marking of the staging locations and the big 10&#8217;s number.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What could be improved</h2>

<ul>
<li>Briefing: For day of, briefing should be reduced to 1 or 2 pages. Maps had overlays that needed to be removed to be printed. Needs to be in a more open format than PowerPoint as many people are moving away from the MS tool suite.</li>
<li>Tactical/Call-Sign use: There was a lack of tacticals used, making it hard to identify where people were sending information from. Call signs still need to be used at the end of transmission. There was a lack of call signs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>For the race</h3>

<ul>
<li>Communication to the participants seemed to be odd. Some showed up with instructions to rally at Beville, but they were not actually staging at Beville. Not sure why this happened.</li>
<li>Units need to be given numbers for the front unit of their organization. This helps us know who is out of order when they are passing and for unit insertion.</li>
<li>Need to decide if Beville is a unit staging location or a rally location. There is not enough room for the 13 units that had to stage there, plus probably another dozen units that decided they were going to meet there, including units near to the numbers that were staging at Beville.</li>
<li>Race director should not be granting &#8220;sure, you can park there&#8221; to units that are not scheduled to stage there. Specifically unit 71 was told to unload and stage, but there were no markings or location to stage them, requiring day of juggling.</li>
<li>Names need to be &#8220;normalized.&#8221; For example, the political folks were all over the map - some as &#8220;delegate,&#8221; some by their last name, and some by their first. Similarly, units entered as one organization but showing up as another - for example the Elks registered but their scout troop showed up. Girl Scouts registered as a service area, but their people did not know what area they were associated with.</li>
<li>Registered parade units need to pass the number of their unit down to their rank and file to make it easier to find them (especially when the names are not normalized).</li>
<li>We had a unit of autistic scouts placed behind a loud music entry. Probably needs to be identified before hand.</li>
<li>I know it is a tradition, but throwing candy is just not safe. A couple of near misses again this year.</li>
</ul>
