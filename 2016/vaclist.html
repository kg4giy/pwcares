<h1 id="princewilliamcountyamateurradioemergencyservicepwcares">Prince William County Amateur Radio Emergency Service (PWCARES)</h1>

<p>The Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) consists of licensed amateurs who have voluntarily registered their qualifications and equipment, with their local ARES leadership, for communications duty in the public service when disaster strikes. Every licensed amateur, regardless of membership in the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) or any other local or national organization is eligible to apply for membership in ARES. Training may be required or desired to participate fully in ARES. ARES is an Amateur Radio program, only licensed radio amateurs are eligible for membership. </p>

<p>PWCARES provides communications support to the Cities of Manassas and Manassas Park, as well as Prince William County in the event of emergency or unforeseen communications interruption. PWCARES also supports the Sentra and Novant hospital networks, and the American Red Cross. PWCARES provides communication support to other organization, such as the Marine Corps Marathon program office for their events in Prince William County, such as the Crossroads 17.75 and the Turkey Trot. All of our members are volunteers, train regularly with various county and other civil organizations, and provide education about Amateur Radio in disasters. </p>
